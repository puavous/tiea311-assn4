This is an adapted "exercise starter code" based on the following:

IMPORTANT:

- Please, do NOT make a public repository containing your answer code,
  because it makes it easier for freeloaders to just copy-paste
  without learning!

  Instead, use a workflow with a private repository or just a "working
  copy" on your computer. To avoid unnecessary crying, keep back-ups
  for example on the university server.

- Do not be a freeloader: Some student answers seem to be available
  around the WWW ... Observe, first of all, that plagiarism is a major
  offence, subject to severe punishments and resulting shame.

  Perhaps more importantly, you will not learn by brainless
  copy-paste.

  And lastly, some of the available answers are actually pretty
  incompetent. You'll do much better, won't you! :)

The self-assessment template "Itsearvio.txt" file is in Finnish,
because these codes are adapted to our local course that is taught in
Finnish: http://users.jyu.fi/~nieminen/tgp19/
